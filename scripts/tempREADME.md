I have been looking for a new job since past few months and have 3 offers right now. An interview with AWS is on its way.
​
Education: MS in CS from a decent university in Washington DC. Locally it holds a high value bc there are no high profile universities in this area.
Prior Experience:

$Internship - None. Some work-study at college but that is non technical
$RealJob - 3 years in my home country. I am an immigrant. 1.8 years in a small company (almost a startup) in NoVA area.
Company/Industry: IT infrastructure / DevOps / Cloud Tech
​
Offer 1: They offered me this, then had some major cross-company change in their hiring and they decided to halt the offer for a while. I might be contacted later and be subjected to take a coding test by a 3rd party. What assholes!. I also have a suspicion on the recruiter that probably she is lying and is doing this just to me.
Title: DevOps Engineer
Tenure length: NA
Location: Austin
Salary: 125k base
Relocation/Signing Bonus: 3k initial no questions asked, any expense post that reimbursed on show of receipts. Rental car, storage, etc provided for first 2 weeks of joining
Stock and/or recurring bonuses: 15k RSUs invested across 3 years, 15% of base bonus subjected to company performance.
Total comp: ~140k for 3 years (Assuming I make 10k off the bonus each year + 5k from RSUs each year), 135k post 3 years.
​
Offer 2:
Title: Senior DevOps Engineer
Tenure length: NA
Location: Minneapolis
Salary: 120k base
Relocation/Signing Bonus: None
Stock and/or recurring bonuses: None
Total comp: 120k
​
Offer 3: Accepted
Title: Senior DevOps Engineer
Tenure length: NA
Location: Minneapolis
Salary: 125k base
Relocation/Signing Bonus: 5k
Stock and/or recurring bonuses: 1.5k flat bonus if I satisfy the minimum performance criteria
Total comp: 125k (5k signing bonus is one time thing)
​
Redditors, please advice me if that salary is good enough and justified:
To live in MPLS
For a person with 5 years of experience in the field
I am still on the fence. I feel lowballed by Offers # 2 and 3. But that is the best I could extract from them.

Sidenote, this is the first year Amazon has advertised internships afaik. I'm applying so if I hit the hail mary then I might have numbers for them for the next thread. Since both Google and Expedia haven't gotten back to me (ever) though I somehow doubt Amazon would

```

```
Amazon has advertised internships since 2017. Intern salary is $47 per hour but no relocation/housing - good luck it's extremely competitive! 
Google's intern salary is a bit less at around $35-40 per hour, but housing is provided if you need it and there's free meals in the office :)
PM if you want more info
