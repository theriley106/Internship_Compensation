Company/Industry: Optiver
Title: Software Developer Intern
Location: Sydney
Duration: 12 weeks
Salary: $75,000 plus super (pro-rated) - for those outside AU super is just 401k, this means it'll probably be about 82.5k total assuming 10% super 
Relocation/Housing Stipend: Provided housing if outside of Sydney
Sidenote: their hackerrank was pretty damn tough so that 75k pro-rated is well deserved. Don't know how some of you guys do it tbh

Location: Brisbane
Duration: flexible, during semester
Salary: 22.50/hour 
Relocation/Housing Stipend: None
As a side note, I've been talking to a lot of people I know from uni about their internships/work this last summer and the general figure of $30/hour seems very standard, at least for good engineering companies in Brisbane. Only notable exception I know of is a particularly large defence contractor (you can probably guess which), virtually every mining company, and if Amazon takes interns I would assume they pay a little higher as well. 
The company I was at had plenty of unpaid interns actually, which is unfortunately pretty common here because of the 30 day supervised work requirement for engineering students. It seems to be that a lot of the work is geared towards them, and the paid stuff (while good) is just a little less common.

```You're dramatically overestimating the taxes involved. Actual taxes for this (assuming 3 months of salary + stipend):
Total Income: $35,925
Federal: $2421.84
CA State: $645.30
FICA/Medicare: $2,748.26
This doesn't include their home state rate, but CA has one of the highest state income tax rates in the union, and states generally credit you for taxes paid in other states, so this is going to be within a few hundred dollars of the correct number.
Total combined tax rate is ~16%, meaning $3500 becomes ~$2940. If OP pays their tuition with that money and provides more than 50% of their own total support this calendar year they can take their own education tax credit, which means they will only pay FICA/Medicare, for a total tax burden of 7.65%, or a take home of $3232.25 of each $3500.
tl:dr - Amazon convenience housing costs OP $3440-3732 post-tax each month.

Company/Industry: Industry typically known for paying less
Title: Programmer intern

Duration: 3 months

Relocation/Housing Stipend: None. I am a local so none needed either.
Sucks but it gets worse. I know a few people that got $12.75/hour in SF. This was at a rather small tech company owned by a much larger corporation. We all took these offers because when you have no experience, you take what you can get and then hope to build off it. It's obviously a terrible feeling knowing everyone else out here is making at minimum 2x as much and you're the lowest paid, but oh well. 
If i could do it again, i would do a ton of side projects to put on my resume that would make it much more attractive. This would give me a chance at getting interviews for actual better internships. Then it is a matter of studying CTCI to pass the interview.

```Already had my internship this year (mine are from Jan to April) but so far I do have one return offer for 2020 which stands as such:
School: UWaterloo, will be in 4th year
Prior experience: 3 internships (1 year total, all software dev)
Company/Industry: top 5 bank
Title: Software Engineer Co-op
Location: Toronto
Duration: 16 weeks
Salary: $33.30CAD/hour (for those wondering, they paid $30.75 this year that I worked for them)

Other benefits: 4 paid days off, employee banking benefits like market exchange rates (useful for traveling and investing in foreign assets)
Fairly good offer for Ontario, haven't been able to land any better ones. I haven't accepted it yet, I'm still applying to some places in the States (mainly interested in medium CoL cities like Chicago and Austin), but I'm open to live anywhere if the work is interesting and pays well. If anyone has any advice for landing a FinTech job in the States (e.g. at a bank, hedge fund, etc), I'd love to hear it!

```School/Year:  Junior @ State School you’ve heard of but not super well known for CS
Prior Experience: Previous degree and nearly a decade in a non tech role. Was told after they hired me that they liked my having a degree and work experience. The other intern with me is also a guy my age. 
Company/Industry:  Defense Contractor. 
Title:  Software Engineering Intern
Location:  PacNW
Duration:  Indefinite
Salary:  $15.00/hr
Relocation/Housing Stipend:  None. 
They had posted the internship on my school’s job board online. Usually our department chair will email out internships like this but they never did. I got lucky in seeing it and sent in my resume and cover letter. Got an interview a week or so later and was offered the position on the spot. No coding challenges although they did ask about my projects and the stuff i learned in school. I was a little bummed when i started because it seemed less technical than i was expecting but we pivoted a week in and I’m now working on a super cool project in Unity and my friends all lament that i got the perfect opportunity lol.

```I read the mod note and am not trying to troll. If people find this useful by all means I won't stand in the way.
That being said, I feel like an intern's primary goal should be to make sure they're working somewhere that provides valuable experience. That being said, I also think interns should be paid well, but it should take a back seat to how it the experience will position you in the future.
I was an intern for three years, and now interview intern candidates each year. When I looked for internships for myself, I looked for things like:
Are interns embedded with the other software engineers (preferred), or working on another project on the side?
Does the salary cover all of my living expenses plus a little extra?
Will I get strong mentorship from an experienced engineer?
Will the work be interesting, enjoyable, and challenging?
Is there an opportunity to work part time after going back to school?
These are all way more important to your career than salary. Yet still, I interview some interns who will have multiple offers that will compare them more or less based on the salary. Like, $company is paying me $x, can you match that? Nothing terribly wrong with asking that question, but for many of them it's clear that the answer is a strong determinant of where they will chose to work, which I think is wrong.

Definitely would not recommend BNY Mellon if you have other options. The superday was very unorganized, and IMO the whole "innovation center" concept is a sham. Also, they don't give full-time return offers to interns (you would have to reapply and enter the same application pipeline as external applicants).
