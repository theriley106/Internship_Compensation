```I have been looking for a new job since past few months and have 3 offers right now. An interview with AWS is on its way.
​
Education: MS in CS from a decent university in Washington DC. Locally it holds a high value bc there are no high profile universities in this area.
Prior Experience:

$Internship - None. Some work-study at college but that is non technical
$RealJob - 3 years in my home country. I am an immigrant. 1.8 years in a small company (almost a startup) in NoVA area.
Company/Industry: IT infrastructure / DevOps / Cloud Tech
​
Offer 1: They offered me this, then had some major cross-company change in their hiring and they decided to halt the offer for a while. I might be contacted later and be subjected to take a coding test by a 3rd party. What assholes!. I also have a suspicion on the recruiter that probably she is lying and is doing this just to me.
Title: DevOps Engineer
Tenure length: NA
Location: Austin
Salary: 125k base
Relocation/Signing Bonus: 3k initial no questions asked, any expense post that reimbursed on show of receipts. Rental car, storage, etc provided for first 2 weeks of joining
Stock and/or recurring bonuses: 15k RSUs invested across 3 years, 15% of base bonus subjected to company performance.
Total comp: ~140k for 3 years (Assuming I make 10k off the bonus each year + 5k from RSUs each year), 135k post 3 years.
​
Offer 2:
Title: Senior DevOps Engineer
Tenure length: NA
Location: Minneapolis
Salary: 120k base
Relocation/Signing Bonus: None
Stock and/or recurring bonuses: None
Total comp: 120k
​
Offer 3: Accepted
Title: Senior DevOps Engineer

Location: Minneapolis
Salary: 125k base
Relocation/Signing Bonus: 5k
Stock and/or recurring bonuses: 1.5k flat bonus if I satisfy the minimum performance criteria
Total comp: 125k (5k signing bonus is one time thing)
​
Redditors, please advice me if that salary is good enough and justified:
To live in MPLS
For a person with 5 years of experience in the field
I am still on the fence. I feel lowballed by Offers # 2 and 3. But that is the best I could extract from them.

Sidenote, this is the first year Amazon has advertised internships afaik. I'm applying so if I hit the hail mary then I might have numbers for them for the next thread. Since both Google and Expedia haven't gotten back to me (ever) though I somehow doubt Amazon would
```

```Amazon has advertised internships since 2017. Intern salary is $47 per hour but no relocation/housing - good luck it's extremely competitive! 
Google's intern salary is a bit less at around $35-40 per hour, but housing is provided if you need it and there's free meals in the office :)

Company/Industry: Optiver
Title: Software Developer Intern
Location: Sydney
Duration: 12 weeks
Salary: $75,000 plus super (pro-rated) - for those outside AU super is just 401k, this means it'll probably be about 82.5k total assuming 10% super 
Relocation/Housing Stipend: Provided housing if outside of Sydney
Sidenote: their hackerrank was pretty damn tough so that 75k pro-rated is well deserved. Don't know how some of you guys do it tbh
Company/Industry: Tiny manufacturing shop
Title: Electical Eng/Software Eng Intern 
Location: Brisbane
Duration: flexible, during semester
Salary: 22.50/hour 
Relocation/Housing Stipend: None
As a side note, I've been talking to a lot of people I know from uni about their internships/work this last summer and the general figure of $30/hour seems very standard, at least for good engineering companies in Brisbane. Only notable exception I know of is a particularly large defence contractor (you can probably guess which), virtually every mining company, and if Amazon takes interns I would assume they pay a little higher as well. 
The company I was at had plenty of unpaid interns actually, which is unfortunately pretty common here because of the 30 day supervised work requirement for engineering students. It seems to be that a lot of the work is geared towards them, and the paid stuff (while good) is just a little less common.

Kinda wanna move back to the midwest (ORD-IND-CVG), but I don't know if it makes sense financially.  In SEA, I've got a great apt for $1100/mo withing walking distance of work/nightlife/everything, and I've got plenty of fun money while still maxing HSA/401k/savings/etc (and saving stock for a down payment somewhere someday).  Everywhere in the midwest, I'd be taking a big salary cut, would start paying state income taxes, and might need a car if it's not Chicago.  Like, yeah, a dozen eggs are $1 cheaper, but that doesn't make up for a base salary that is $20-40k lower and probably not getting $70k of stock per year~
Gonna wait and see where HQ2 shakes out and will go from there.

Salary: $8475/month

```You're dramatically overestimating the taxes involved. Actual taxes for this (assuming 3 months of salary + stipend):
Total Income: $35,925
Federal: $2421.84
CA State: $645.30
FICA/Medicare: $2,748.26
This doesn't include their home state rate, but CA has one of the highest state income tax rates in the union, and states generally credit you for taxes paid in other states, so this is going to be within a few hundred dollars of the correct number.
Total combined tax rate is ~16%, meaning $3500 becomes ~$2940. If OP pays their tuition with that money and provides more than 50% of their own total support this calendar year they can take their own education tax credit, which means they will only pay FICA/Medicare, for a total tax burden of 7.65%, or a take home of $3232.25 of each $3500.
tl:dr - Amazon convenience housing costs OP $3440-3732 post-tax each month.

Picked Google! Excited for it, it's in a product area I use and am quite excited about. Doing the finance route in NY would have been interesting, but as an international student with visa struggles I decided to play it a bit more conservatively at the start, and get a good network going before risking the hire/fire culture of big-risk, big-reward firms which would tend to put visa holders in more jeopardy. It's a field I'd love to at least experience some day.
Started with a FB return offer from the summer, and only interviewed at places which I thought I might take over it. These were Google, some financial firms (other than the one above, about 50% rejected/50% I ended process early after accepting Google), and a couple of unicorns (1 rejected, 1 I ended process early after accepting Google.)

Facebook rejected me at first saying that while I did excellent on the coding interviews + behavoural, I did not do well on the system design interviews. 
That made me a solid E3-level hire but not quite E4 material. They were looking for E4s and had no room for E3s so they rejected me.
Later they reached out and said that another team in enterprise engineering was interested in me. I got the offer, negotiated a bit and accepted it.
From what I understand the difference in compensation between enterprise engineers and other software engineers is that enterprise engineers get less RSUs. Moving from EE to SE also requires 1 year tenure and another interview loop.

I took a massive gamble and accepted the sdc company. The higher ups must be ridiculously confident in the company from the offer. I was very impressed by the employees and HR was very kind.
The Robinhood offer was not negotiated (I'm not sure if they even allow for negotiation considering their sketchy offer tactics). I left out other offers because they were already listed above.

Title: Software Engineer
Location: Menlo Park, CA
Total comp: $130k/yr + $50k signing

Salary: $130k
Stock: $216k/4 (RSU)
Signing: $50k

I took a massive gamble and accepted the sdc company. The higher ups must be ridiculously confident in the company from the offer. I was very impressed by the employees and HR was very kind.
The Robinhood offer was not negotiated (I'm not sure if they even allow for negotiation considering their sketchy offer tactics). I left out other offers because they were already listed above.

```I guess I'll update this yet again. Still looking for work, still none to be had (or at least only really low wages) for programmers in Windsor, ON so I'm still at the same place.
Education: Two bachelor's degrees in CS and Business Administration (University of Windsor), two Associates degrees in Programmer Analyst and Network Services Technologist (St. Clair College), and a trade certificate in Tech Support (also St. Clair College)
Prior Experience:

Real job: 5 years of working tech support over the phones for an ISP, helping users reset routers and the like.
Internship: Unpaid, programming for local utilities company for 6 months
Internship: Unpaid, networking / sysadmin for same utilities company
Company/Industry: Auto industry, working on the website / ERP system that tracks inventory and provides work instructions to employees. The company itself provides parts to the Big 3. I'm usually a full-stack web dev, but have to wear "many hats" as I need to be able to handle any IT-ish need that the company could think of.

Very low COL; as an example my 90 year old 3 bed/1 bath house costed me only $90K when bought in 2015.

```Honestly I applied anywhere and everywhere when I graduated. I moved to Wisconsin for my first job just because it was the only place that would accept me. I've moved to WI, NC, and NYC for jobs before CA. I just moved where I could until I became more desirable for companies I wanted to work at.
Not everyone gets interviews with FB/G out of college or even pass them. There's nothing wrong starting at low salary places and moving up :)

2 month as a junior soft. eng. (left during probation period)
Company: CME

```Education: BS from top-ranked institute of science and tech that is less good in CS and didn't offer it as an official major at the time. My degree is officially in engineering. I took mostly CS courses but didn't complete the CS concentration I could have gotten on my transcript. 
Prior experience: Summer internship in Silicon Valley startup, on-campus job doing LaTeX typesetting, 2 years trying to start my own business.
Company/industry: University
Title: Went from programmer/systems administrator to just systems administrator, although I still maintain software projects.
Tenure length: 12 years
Location: LA
Salary: $72k. Started at $45k. With small annual raises and one bigger raise, I ended up at $56k in 10 years. Two years ago, I got a big raise to $72k. My position was upgraded from the most junior level, and the "programmer" part of my job title was dropped. The latter is a problem because I'm afraid of being expected to take more ownership of hardware, which I hate doing, and ending up even less employable.
Total comp: I'm not sure how much my benefits are worth. Benefits are good overall, but no bonuses.

What I did: To be completely honest with you guys, I don't contribute at all to open source projects or anything like that in my spare time. I don't even have a GitHub account. However, I practice algorithm problems a lot. I usually spend 2-3 hours per day (since freshman year of college) working on algorithm problems during the week and 3-5 hours per day on the weekend. I've completed around 250 problems on LeetCode as well as many problems in various books and other online sites. 
As a result, I am extremely good at algorithm problems, but I don't know much about software engineering fundamentals like networks, databases, web development, and that kind of thing. I am just really good at solving algorithm problems in C#, C++, Java, and Python. That is what companies want to see most, from my time spent interviewing. Although I did fail several interviews because I didn't know basic web dev concepts (don't know anything about JavaScript or HTML/CSS), but most companies just cared about the algorithm problems in interviews and not much about anything else.

Stock: ~10k that kicks in every year after 3rd year
Total comp: 194.5 first year, 164.5 for 2 years after, 175 every year after that
Notes: Medium-sized (~2000 engineers) company that I interned at. 
Great culture, fantastic work-life balance. 
Really hard looking at these numbers, knowing I turned it down 
but their SF office is quite small and with few senior engineers,
and I was explicitly looking to be surrounded by people with way more experience than me.
Overall Notes:
I suuuuuuper suck at interviewing :/ not much to say there. 
SF salaries end up getting a huge chunk taken out of them for COL/income taxes, especially since California also has a 8.5% sales tax. My take-home is going to be about 100k and I'll probably end up spending 2700/month on rent + utilities (really hoping to find a studio). So if you live in a different part of the country, keep that in mind before you start comparing salaries. 
I was looking at staying in my current state and even with a 35k+ paycut, I would have ended up ahead just because of the rent and tax differences. I'll probably move back here after a few years, but I really like SF and am willing to take the overall cut in salary for now.

## directly

```I’m currently on a September comp cycle, so these numbers are brand new and reflect my raise for the year.
Note there’s a lot of variance in my yearly "income" since more than half my comp is RSUs alone now, and changes to stock price will significantly affect both my assets and my W2 income.
Education: MS CS at Cornell, BS CSE from a state school
Prior Experience: 17 years in operating systems and file systems
Company/Industry: systems software company that I've been with since before its IPO
Title: (titles are semi-meaningless.  I report to a director, not a first line manager; I provide technical direction to several tech leads.  More on that below)
Tenure length: 4 years at this gig
Location: South Bay
Salary: $230k (unchanged from last year)
Bonus: $45k target (up from $30k last year)
Stock options: this is the hard one.  I have options, which are partly mature and do add to my total income from the company.  The initial grant I received when I hired on is fully vested as of this month and is currently worth about $1M pre-tax, though I’ve already sold off some of it.  Two refresh grants from '15 and '16 are valued at $285k and $205k based on today’s stock price, but are not yet fully vested (four year vest); however they also run out sooner than any of my RSU grants (below).  I didn’t count any of that as income before in either my mental models of my comp, or my previous reports in salary sharing threads, because for a while the options couldn't be traded (pre-IPO) and then for a while they were underwater.
RSUs: This math is much less hard than the options.  I've now got 4 overlapping grants, totaling $425k/year at today's stock price.  But some of them are 4 year grants, one is 3 years, one is 3.5.  So while they run out at slightly different times, two years from now three of the four will be done.  That will be an interesting time, to see if future grants make up for it.  This year's grant is $200k over 3.5 years; the actual RSU count will be determined by an average of the stock trading price later this month.
Total comp: over $700k/year ($230k + $45k + $425k); you can decide how to count the income from maturing stock options as you like.  I tend to let the money sit until I e.g. want to buy or remodel a house, and it's been a few years since I did that.
2018 raise: $72k, or a hair north of 10%.  This is the third year in a row with a raise over 10%.  That raise is more money than I made my first year out of college.
To answer some other questions I often get or am likely to get:
I'm really, really good at what I do
I optimized my career for working on things I like, not money; I've quit jobs when they got boring or when I felt like my efforts weren't recognized, but I never took a job just because it paid more.  I missed out on over $100k one year in RSUs and other comp when I switched jobs to a startup that didn't work out.  But it was a very educational year there before I took this current gig.
My salary was quite modest until three years ago; when I started this job it was just $190k salary, paper options (pre-IPO), and no bonus.  But it was a product and team I believed in, and I've worked quite hard for them in the years since.
I optimize my work time for being productive, not social.  My colleagues have described me as "intense"; one told me as he was leaving for a new job that he learned a lot from both a co-worker and me; he said the other co-worker was always "patient with his questions", of course implying I’m not patient :-).  I know I'm not patient with colleagues who waste my time by asking questions when they haven't done their homework, and I'm also a little impatient with colleagues who waste our collective time by spending too long trying to find an answer before coming to me.  Yes, I'm trying to improve as a human being.  Yes, it's hard work.  But I will spend a lot of time explaining things and teaching to people who are listening and learning and putting in their own hard work.  If you don't waste my time, I'll give you lots of my time and energy.
I directly or indirectly influence about 80 of the 100 or so engineers on our product, either because they're on teams I work with, or because I'm writing wiki entries on our coding style and rationale, or because I'm giving tech talks, or through hiring, or arguing against adding processes, or ... lots and lots of things.
I serve as a technical lead for multiple tech leads working on various projects.  That means I'm not specifically in charge of any deliverable / feature, but I do need to meet regularly with the tech leads 1-1 to chat and make sure they're on course, they have the resources they need, etc.  I review designs and some of the code; I'm available any time they need to chat about problems they've come across in their work.
I have no people management responsibilities and I don't want any; I still write code though it's even less than last year.  Maybe 40% of my time is writing code (low level stuff like our C++ coding framework), the rest is doing code and design reviews and 1-1 meetings and various process meetings.  For instance, I'm on our Patent Review Board, our promotions board, an Interview Process committee, and I do one or two engineering interviews a week, of all levels from new hire to experienced industry hire.
My number one value I bring to an organization is problem solving, whether it's technical or non-technical problems.  Clarity of thought and concise framing of problems are invaluable to many organizations.
Yes, I can get quite wordy.  Like Pascal, I lack the time to make this a shorter letter.
Yes, when I added it up, I said "holy f*ck".  I never expected to be making this much money, in my wildest dreams.

Sucks but it gets worse. I know a few people that got $12.75/hour in SF. This was at a rather small tech company owned by a much larger corporation. We all took these offers because when you have no experience, you take what you can get and then hope to build off it. It's obviously a terrible feeling knowing everyone else out here is making at minimum 2x as much and you're the lowest paid, but oh well. 
If i could do it again, i would do a ton of side projects to put on my resume that would make it much more attractive. This would give me a chance at getting interviews for actual better internships. Then it is a matter of studying CTCI to pass the interview.

```The young'ins had their chance, now it's time for us geezers to shine! This thread is for sharing recent offers/current salaries for professionals with 2 or more years of experience.
Please only post an offer if you're including hard numbers, but feel free to use a throwaway account if you're concerned about anonymity. You can also genericize some of your answers (e.g. "Biotech company" or "Hideously Overvalued Unicorn"), or add fields if you feel something is particularly relevant.

Note that you only really need to include the relocation/signing bonus into the total comp if it was a recent thing. Also, while the primary purpose of these threads is obviously to share compensation info, discussion is also encouraged.
The format here is slightly unusual, so please make sure to post under the appropriate top-level thread, which are: US [High/Medium/Low] CoL, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Latin America, ANZC, Asia, or Other.
If you don't work in the US, you can ignore the rest of this post. To determine cost of living buckets, I used this site: http://www.bestplaces.net/
If the principal city of your metro is not in the reference list below, go to bestplaces, type in the name of the principal city (or city where you work in if there's no such thing), and then click "Cost of Living" in the left sidebar. The buckets are based on the Overall number: [Low: < 100], [Medium: >= 100, < 150], [High: >= 150].
High CoL: NYC, LA, DC, SF Bay Area, Seattle, Boston, San Diego

My first job started at ~$50k/year in '06, when I left that company in 2016 I was at $120k/year. Second job started at $150k and left at 185k. Decided to take a fast-track to early retirement and sell-out to one of the big tech firms you know. I'll ride this out for the next few years until my house and vacation property are paid off then I'm fucking done with this shit and I'm going off the grid forever.

Education: B.S. in Computer Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh in May 2014
Prior Experience:

3 semesters of internship with a large manufacturing company in test engineering, new development hardware design, and operations in a manufacturing plant
6/14-6/15: Software Engineer with the same above company
6/15-9/16: Software Engineer with a high-performance computer company working on storage
9/16-2/19: Software Engineer working on back-end Java/Spring APIs at a large legal technology company
Company/Industry: Fortune 50 retail company
Title: Software Engineer
Tenure length: 1 month
Location: Minneapolis, MN
Salary: $90,000
Relocation/Signing Bonus: $7,000 signing
Stock and/or recurring bonuses: 3.5% annual bonus target
Total comp: $93,150

```

```I ran some very basic and rudimentary calculations using SmartAsset.com's paycheck calculator comparing a high COL city (SF) to a low COL city (PHX), assuming a few things: a 5% 401k contribution each paycheck, rent for a 1 bedroom apartment (maybe...it could be like $10,000 in SF for all I know. Probably low balled it a bit there), $70 for internet, and $80 for combined utils, along with a 1.8% tax withholding in PHX.
EDIT: For clarification, the rent price I listed is rent + utils + internet. It also is considering high quality, luxury style apartments. After looking more on the SF side of things, I think the average cost would probably be closer to 3200. In that case, the total housing costs per year would be closer to $38,400, and the take home would be $56,110. ~ish.
SF
Salary: $150,000
401k: 5%
Bi-weekly take home: $3635
Post-tax annual take home: 94,510
Rent: $2950 estimated (+ util and rent) / month = 35,400
Take home minus rent = $59,110
PHX
Salary: $82,000
401k: 5%
Bi-weekly take home: $2,264
Post-tax annual take home: $58,864
Rent: $1650 ( + internet and utils) / month = $19,800
Take home minus rent = $39,064
Again, don't take these numbers as gospel, but just as a quick, rough comparison, a $70,000 difference translates to about $20,000 in take home dollars between these two cities...although, I would argue Phoenix should be considered Medium COL, but eh. Every city will be different anyway.

```Education: Bachelor of Science: Computing Science. Non-target school that isn't well known
Prior Experience:
          3 internships at medium sized software company
          1 internship at Microsoft
Company/Industry: Microsoft
Title: Software Developer I
Tenure length: Will be starting in few months.
Location: Redmond, WA
Salary: 108,000
Relocation/Signing Bonus: 
          35,000. 25,000 in first year and 10,000 in second year. 
          Relocation is fully paid for and includes transportation, meals, rental car, moving container, etc
Stock and/or recurring bonuses: 120k over 3.5 years (25% at 6 months, then 25% every year)
Total comp (guaranteed): 163,000 in first year, 148,000 in second, and 138,000 thereafter
Other compensation
          15 days of paid vacation and 10 days of paid sick leave. 2 personal days
          0-20% target bonus
          Good healthcare plan. No deductible and $1,500 max out of pocket expenses
          50% 401k contribution up to max contribution of 9,000.
          Free gym membership or $800 per year for personal exercise equipment 
Other info: I know that many interns receive full time job offers from Microsoft, but I was working in a small division in a completely different location. The internship had very little to do with my current job offer; I applied as external candidate and underwent the standard new graduate hiring process. I negotiated my signing bonus from 25,000 to 35,000. 
Editing: Adding some more details
My interviews went really well which helped me get a good offer. 
By the time the 3rd interview endd, Microsoft usually knows if they are going to hire you or not. If they decide to hire you, your 4th interview will be "as-necessary" which is basically someone trying to convince you to join them. They asked about my interests, the team I wanted to join, and if I had any doubts about working at Microsoft.

```The young'ins had their chance, now it's time for us geezers to shine! This thread is for sharing recent offers/current salaries for professionals with 2 or more years of experience.
Please only post an offer if you're including hard numbers, but feel free to use a throwaway account if you're concerned about anonymity. You can also genericize some of your answers (e.g. "Biotech company" or "Hideously Overvalued Unicorn"), or add fields if you feel something is particularly relevant.

Note that you only really need to include the relocation/signing bonus into the total comp if it was a recent thing. Also, while the primary purpose of these threads is obviously to share compensation info, discussion is also encouraged.
The format here is slightly unusual, so please make sure to post under the appropriate top-level thread, which are: US [High/Medium/Low] CoL, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Latin America, ANZC, Asia, or Other.
If you don't work in the US, you can ignore the rest of this post. To determine cost of living buckets, I used this site: http://www.bestplaces.net/
If the principal city of your metro is not in the reference list below, go to bestplaces, type in the name of the principal city (or city where you work in if there's no such thing), and then click "Cost of Living" in the left sidebar. The buckets are based on the Overall number: [Low: < 100], [Medium: >= 100, < 150], [High: >= 150].
High CoL: NYC, LA, DC, SF Bay Area, Seattle, Boston, San Diego
Medium CoL: Chicago, Houston, Miami, Atlanta, Riverside, Minneapolis, Denver, Portland, Sacramento, Las Vegas, Austin, Raleigh
Low CoL: Dallas, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Detroit, Tampa, St. Louis, Baltimore, Charlotte, Orlando, San Antonio, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Kansas City

```Don't want to be doxxed, so keeping it vague. Just want to share what's possible out there.
Education: BS in unrelated engineering, bootcamp
Prior Experience: 1.5 years at no name comp; 1 year well-known comp
Company/Industry: Pre IPO Unicorn
Title: Sr Software Engineer
Tenure Length: ~couple months
Location: One of the cities in Medium COL, keeping it vague
Salary: $120k
Relocation/Signing Bonus: $5k / $0k
Stock and/or recurring bonuses: Bonus based on revenue, anywhere from $50k - $100k. Common stock worth ~ $0k but with FMV (fair market value) around $50k/year.
Total comp: $170k-$220k cash. If you count RSUs, range is $220k - $270k.
I'm an outlier for sure. This is semi-remote also.
I stand to make a decent amount of money if the IPO goes well ... whenever that is.

## glassdoor

```Obviously this is not the norm. But such salary do exist for foreigners. I had alternate offers (in other countries) so maybe that played some part as well.
Cost of living is really cheap...
Not really but yeah I agree it's cheaper if you compared to US high COL. The housing is provided so it definitely boosts the saving a lot :) 
PS: sites like glassdoor don't have reliable figures when it comes to job outside US.

## dropbox

```You should be able to EASILY get 120k / 3.5 years with Microsoft. They give that to people from no-name school who just negotiate a bit without any competing offers. With 2 Big 4 internships and a Dropbox competing offer, it should be pretty easy.
With the 120k / 3.5 years, the Microsoft offer might be better. I think Dropbox just filed for IPO about 2 weeks ago, so it's still paper money, and you won't get to cash out like the people who are there since many years. If it's anything like the Snapchat IPO, it might be worth a lot less in the nest few months.
For the experience, Dropbox might be better, but if your decision is based solely on compensation, get that 120k stock and MSFT is definitely better. Or try and negotiate with Dropbox, but I don't they will without a competing offer from a better Big 4.
EDIT: MSFT also has a target bonus of 10%, with a max of 20%. So you can add around 10.8k to that base salary if you're just an average new grad.

## cover

```School/Year:  Junior @ State School you’ve heard of but not super well known for CS
Prior Experience: Previous degree and nearly a decade in a non tech role. Was told after they hired me that they liked my having a degree and work experience. The other intern with me is also a guy my age. 
Company/Industry:  Defense Contractor. 
Title:  Software Engineering Intern
Location:  PacNW
Duration:  Indefinite
Salary:  $15.00/hr
Relocation/Housing Stipend:  None. 
They had posted the internship on my school’s job board online. Usually our department chair will email out internships like this but they never did. I got lucky in seeing it and sent in my resume and cover letter. Got an interview a week or so later and was offered the position on the spot. No coding challenges although they did ask about my projects and the stuff i learned in school. I was a little bummed when i started because it seemed less technical than i was expecting but we pivoted a week in and I’m now working on a super cool project in Unity and my friends all lament that i got the perfect opportunity lol.

```I read the mod note and am not trying to troll. If people find this useful by all means I won't stand in the way.
That being said, I feel like an intern's primary goal should be to make sure they're working somewhere that provides valuable experience. That being said, I also think interns should be paid well, but it should take a back seat to how it the experience will position you in the future.
I was an intern for three years, and now interview intern candidates each year. When I looked for internships for myself, I looked for things like:
Are interns embedded with the other software engineers (preferred), or working on another project on the side?
Does the salary cover all of my living expenses plus a little extra?
Will I get strong mentorship from an experienced engineer?
Will the work be interesting, enjoyable, and challenging?
Is there an opportunity to work part time after going back to school?
These are all way more important to your career than salary. Yet still, I interview some interns who will have multiple offers that will compare them more or less based on the salary. Like, $company is paying me $x, can you match that? Nothing terribly wrong with asking that question, but for many of them it's clear that the answer is a strong determinant of where they will chose to work, which I think is wrong.

​
Since this was a lateral hire from a Big 4 (~9 months of previous experience at the Big 4), the offer was very compelling to pull you away from the Big 4, matching or exceeding the stocks/bonuses that you were giving up by leaving. I've seen lower offers from Goldman Sachs, but I think those offers are forgetting to include the year-end bonus, which is a huge component compared to most other companies (~$50k y-e bonus/year).

Also, they don't give full-time return offers to interns (you would have to reapply and enter the same application pipeline as external applicants).
