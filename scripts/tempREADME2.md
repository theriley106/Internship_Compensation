```Since internship season has ended in AU I'm just here to give some data points on the openings that I've seen on job boards for internships next summer (2019-2020 here). Link to my post in the last thread for those interested: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a2mafb/official_salary_sharing_thread_for_interns/eazmi0h/
Again I haven't actually gotten offers for the jobs below, just saw the postings (these are ones with salaries)
Company/Industry: Optiver
Title: Software Developer Intern
Location: Sydney
Duration: 12 weeks
Salary: $75,000 plus super (pro-rated) - for those outside AU super is just 401k, this means it'll probably be about 82.5k total assuming 10% super 
Relocation/Housing Stipend: Provided housing if outside of Sydney
Sidenote: their hackerrank was pretty damn tough so that 75k pro-rated is well deserved. Don't know how some of you guys do it tbh
Company/Industry: Tiny manufacturing shop
Title: Electical Eng/Software Eng Intern 
Location: Brisbane
Duration: flexible, during semester
Salary: 22.50/hour 
Relocation/Housing Stipend: None
As a side note, I've been talking to a lot of people I know from uni about their internships/work this last summer and the general figure of $30/hour seems very standard, at least for good engineering companies in Brisbane. Only notable exception I know of is a particularly large defence contractor (you can probably guess which), virtually every mining company, and if Amazon takes interns I would assume they pay a little higher as well. 
The company I was at had plenty of unpaid interns actually, which is unfortunately pretty common here because of the 30 day supervised work requirement for engineering students. It seems to be that a lot of the work is geared towards them, and the paid stuff (while good) is just a little less common.

```Amazon has advertised internships since 2017. Intern salary is $47 per hour but no relocation/housing - good luck it's extremely competitive! 
Google's intern salary is a bit less at around $35-40 per hour, but housing is provided if you need it and there's free meals in the office :)

```You're dramatically overestimating the taxes involved. Actual taxes for this (assuming 3 months of salary + stipend):
Total Income: $35,925
Federal: $2421.84
CA State: $645.30
FICA/Medicare: $2,748.26
This doesn't include their home state rate, but CA has one of the highest state income tax rates in the union, and states generally credit you for taxes paid in other states, so this is going to be within a few hundred dollars of the correct number.
Total combined tax rate is ~16%, meaning $3500 becomes ~$2940. If OP pays their tuition with that money and provides more than 50% of their own total support this calendar year they can take their own education tax credit, which means they will only pay FICA/Medicare, for a total tax burden of 7.65%, or a take home of $3232.25 of each $3500.
tl:dr - Amazon convenience housing costs OP $3440-3732 post-tax each month.

Title: SDE Intern
Location: Palo Alto, CA
Duration: 12 weeks
Salary: $7,650 per month on offer letter. There is a supposed income increase for people working in the Bay Area like me.
Relocation/Housing Stipend: $1,925 post tax per month + plane ticket to and from Palo Alto.
​
Also got a TCP Intern offer from a Optum in their New Jersey office for $24 an hour and housing provided. Just thought I would mention it here even though I declined it.
​
Happy to say that seeing the previous internship salary thread motivated me to work harder on Leetcode and try to be able to post in the next one that happens. Sure enough, I got Amazon (which isn't the best but fuck it I'll take it). Good luck to those looking around and still trying to find an internship!
