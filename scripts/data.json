When I looked for internships for myself, I looked for things like:\nAre interns embedded with the other software engineers (preferred), or working on another project on the side?\nDoes the salary cover all of my living expenses plus a little extra?\nWill I get strong mentorship from an experienced engineer?\nWill the work be interesting, enjoyable, and challenging?\nIs there an opportunity to work part time after going back to school?\nThese are all way more important to your career than salary. Yet still, I interview some interns who will have multiple offers that will compare them more or less based on the salary. Like, $company is paying me $x, can you match that?
