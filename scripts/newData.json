I know plenty of developers in the area with the same or fewer years making $120k+. But I'll admit that the first several years, I did not work on my skills like I should have.\nFirst job was Classic ASP. Nothing from there was going to transfer to anything. haha.\nMy second job at a startup, due to budget they let everyone else go except for me, so the more senior developers that I was going to be able to learn from were gone. But it was really my fault for not learning more on my own.\nIt wasn't until about 5 years ago that I actually got to work with other developers that I could learn from.\n",

The move to the Bay Area has been good to me!  However, if there\u2019s anything that might drive me back to my old MCOL area, it\u2019s the commute. Traffic here is unbearable, and mass transit is kind of sad; if it weren\u2019t for the company bus and being able to count those commute hours as work hours, I\u2019d probably not have taken the job 3 years ago.\nEDIT not counted above: 401K 6% match and ESPP 10% contribution limit with 15% look-back discount.
