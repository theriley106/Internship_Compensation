Don't know how some of you guys do it tbh\n\nCompany/Industry: Tiny manufacturing shop\nTitle: Electical Eng/Software Eng Intern \nLocation: Brisbane\nDuration: flexible, during semester\nSalary: 22.50/hour \nRelocation/Housing Stipend: None\n\nAs a side note, I've been talking to a lot of people I know from uni about their internships/work this last summer and the general figure of $30/hour seems very standard, at least for good engineering companies in Brisbane. Only notable exception I know of is a particularly large defence contractor (you can probably guess which), virtually every mining company, and if Amazon takes interns I would assume they pay a little higher as well. \nThe company I was at had plenty of unpaid interns actually, which is unfortunately pretty common here because of the 30 day supervised work requirement for engineering students. It seems to be that a lot of the work is geared towards them, and the paid stuff (while good) is just a little less common.\n\n",

Weak refreshers.\n* Total comp: $234,000\nNotes: I omitted signing bonuses and relo and perks and the like because they\u2019re relatively token amounts and I\u2019m not a new grad who pads/inflates the numbers. These are real, recurring amounts (see above what I had to say about Snap above).\nAlso, what really sets the tier 1 companies (FB/Google et al) from tier 1.5/2 companies (Microsoft/Amazon) apart is their RSU refresher policy. Amazon notoriously denies refresher grants prior to year 5 if the stock appreciates more than 15%, and Microsoft has long been known to give out terrible refreshers in general (e.g. tiny amounts like $10k vesting over 5 years), whereas at FB (and Snap, if you trust them), your annual TC will grow by $100k+ over four years due to refresh grants stacking.\n\n",

In SEA, I've got a great apt for $1100/mo withing walking distance of work/nightlife/everything, and I've got plenty of fun money while still maxing HSA/401k/savings/etc (and saving stock for a down payment somewhere someday).  Everywhere in the midwest, I'd be taking a big salary cut, would start paying state income taxes, and might need a car if it's not Chicago.  Like, yeah, a dozen eggs are $1 cheaper, but that doesn't make up for a base salary that is $20-40k lower and probably not getting $70k of stock per year~\nGonna wait and see where HQ2 shakes out and will go from there.\n\n",

Will be asking for a raise some time this month so hopefully it works out. I'd also like to add that even though Baltimore is listed as LCoL, if you want to live anywhere safe / desirable, it's at least MCoL, and the closer you get to DC, rent / house prices get bananas. So it might be more accurate to list this under MCoL.\n\n",

Before the program I had about 6 months of self taught experience but really the only thing I learned from that was syntax. I didn't learn a whole lot from my self studying which is why I moved towards this route.

            "comment": "I\u2019m currently on a September comp cycle, so these numbers are brand new and reflect my raise for the year.\nNote there\u2019s a lot of variance in my yearly \"income\" since more than half my comp is RSUs alone now, and changes to stock price will significantly affect both my assets and my W2 income.\n\nEducation: MS CS at Cornell, BS CSE from a state school\nPrior Experience: 17 years in operating systems and file systems\nCompany/Industry: systems software company that I've been with since before its IPO\nTitle: (titles are semi-meaningless.  I report to a director, not a first line manager; I provide technical direction to several tech leads.  More on that below)\nTenure length: 4 years at this gig\nLocation: South Bay\nSalary: $230k (unchanged from last year)\nBonus: $45k target (up from $30k last year)\nStock options: this is the hard one.  I have options, which are partly mature and do add to my total income from the company.  The initial grant I received when I hired on is fully vested as of this month and is currently worth about $1M pre-tax, though I\u2019ve already sold off some of it.  Two refresh grants from '15 and '16 are valued at $285k and $205k based on today\u2019s stock price, but are not yet fully vested (four year vest); however they also run out sooner than any of my RSU grants (below).  I didn\u2019t count any of that as income before in either my mental models of my comp, or my previous reports in salary sharing threads, because for a while the options couldn't be traded (pre-IPO) and then for a while they were underwater.\nRSUs: This math is much less hard than the options.  I've now got 4 overlapping grants, totaling $425k/year at today's stock price.  But some of them are 4 year grants, one is 3 years, one is 3.5.  So while they run out at slightly different times, two years from now three of the four will be done.  That will be an interesting time, to see if future grants make up for it.  This year's grant is $200k over 3.5 years; the actual RSU count will be determined by an average of the stock trading price later this month.\nTotal comp: over $700k/year ($230k + $45k + $425k); you can decide how to count the income from maturing stock options as you like.  I tend to let the money sit until I e.g. want to buy or remodel a house, and it's been a few years since I did that.\n2018 raise: $72k, or a hair north of 10%.  This is the third year in a row with a raise over 10%.  That raise is more money than I made my first year out of college.\n\nTo answer some other questions I often get or am likely to get:\n\nI'm really, really good at what I do\nI optimized my career for working on things I like, not money; I've quit jobs when they got boring or when I felt like my efforts weren't recognized, but I never took a job just because it paid more.  I missed out on over $100k one year in RSUs and other comp when I switched jobs to a startup that didn't work out.  But it was a very educational year there before I took this current gig.\nMy salary was quite modest until three years ago; when I started this job it was just $190k salary, paper options (pre-IPO), and no bonus.  But it was a product and team I believed in, and I've worked quite hard for them in the years since.\nI optimize my work time for being productive, not social.  My colleagues have described me as \"intense\"; one told me as he was leaving for a new job that he learned a lot from both a co-worker and me; he said the other co-worker was always \"patient with his questions\", of course implying I\u2019m not patient :-).  I know I'm not patient with colleagues who waste my time by asking questions when they haven't done their homework, and I'm also a little impatient with colleagues who waste our collective time by spending too long trying to find an answer before coming to me.  Yes, I'm trying to improve as a human being.  Yes, it's hard work.  But I will spend a lot of time explaining things and teaching to people who are listening and learning and putting in their own hard work.  If you don't waste my time, I'll give you lots of my time and energy.\nI directly or indirectly influence about 80 of the 100 or so engineers on our product, either because they're on teams I work with, or because I'm writing wiki entries on our coding style and rationale, or because I'm giving tech talks, or through hiring, or arguing against adding processes, or ... lots and lots of things.\nI serve as a technical lead for multiple tech leads working on various projects.  That means I'm not specifically in charge of any deliverable / feature, but I do need to meet regularly with the tech leads 1-1 to chat and make sure they're on course, they have the resources they need, etc.  I review designs and some of the code; I'm available any time they need to chat about problems they've come across in their work.\nI have no people management responsibilities and I don't want any; I still write code though it's even less than last year.  Maybe 40% of my time is writing code (low level stuff like our C++ coding framework), the rest is doing code and design reviews and 1-1 meetings and various process meetings.  For instance, I'm on our Patent Review Board, our promotions board, an Interview Process committee, and I do one or two engineering interviews a week, of all levels from new hire to experienced industry hire.\nMy number one value I bring to an organization is problem solving, whether it's technical or non-technical problems.  Clarity of thought and concise framing of problems are invaluable to many organizations.\nYes, I can get quite wordy.  Like Pascal, I lack the time to make this a shorter letter.\nYes, when I added it up, I said \"holy f*ck\".  I never expected to be making this much money, in my wildest dreams.\n\n\n",

AS's in Interactive Technology and Web Programming, AA in Computer Graphics.  \nPrior Experience:  Some freelancing (website development, databases, etc), some teaching of intro to programming classes, some 3d modeling.  \nCompany/Industry: Fortune 500, we build scientific and medical hardware.  \nTitle:  Company is weird about titles, my title actually has nothing to do with software.  In terms of job duties it would be most analogous to lead software engineer of a small team.  My actual role is doing VR/AR development.\nTenure length: Two years.  \nLocation:  Small town Ohio.  We're talking super low cost of living (the upper end of the housing market is $100k here)  \nSalary: 85k   \nRelocation: None  \nStock:  None.  There is however an annual christmas bonus equal to 4% of salary and sometimes another performance based bonus equal to 5%.  Additionally there's 401k matching.  All of this is equal to about 13k at my current salary.  \nTotal comp: 98k.\n\n",

Larger salary one would have been a farther relocation immediately, not worth the money.\nVery new here still but loving it so far. It hasn't been easy, but challenging work is interesting work. It's a unique situation where I'm the primary IT guy but also a developer. I have a lot of IT experience but obviously went to school for development. Very IT heavy to start as we're changing the name of the company and moving away from a contracted IT company onto me and hopefully an intern or something soon. Management has been very clear about wanting to expand the tech division here and me being on top of that when it happens, so hopefully a CTO type position within the next few years if we prove we can make it work. Definitely not your typical first job.\n\n",

We all took these offers because when you have no experience, you take what you can get and then hope to build off it. It's obviously a terrible feeling knowing everyone else out here is making at minimum 2x as much and you're the lowest paid, but oh well. \nIf i could do it again, i would do a ton of side projects to put on my resume that would make it much more attractive. This would give me a chance at getting interviews for actual better internships. Then it is a matter of studying CTCI to pass the interview.\n\n",

Probably low balled it a bit there), $70 for internet, and $80 for combined utils, along with a 1.8% tax withholding in PHX.\nEDIT: For clarification, the rent price I listed is rent + utils + internet. It also is considering high quality, luxury style apartments. After looking more on the SF side of things, I think the average cost would probably be closer to 3200. In that case, the total housing costs per year would be closer to $38,400, and the take home would be $56,110. ~ish.\nSF\n\nSalary: $150,000\n401k: 5%\nBi-weekly take home: $3635\nPost-tax annual take home: 94,510\nRent: $2950 estimated (+ util and rent) / month = 35,400\nTake home minus rent = $59,110\n\nPHX\n\nSalary: $82,000\n401k: 5%\nBi-weekly take home: $2,264\nPost-tax annual take home: $58,864\nRent: $1650 ( + internet and utils) / month = $19,800\nTake home minus rent = $39,064\n\nAgain, don't take these numbers as gospel, but just as a quick, rough comparison, a $70,000 difference translates to about $20,000 in take home dollars between these two cities...although, I would argue Phoenix should be considered Medium COL, but eh. Every city will be different anyway.\n\n",

I'm hoping that I can execute on having FI/RE by the age of 30, and \"retire\" for a bit of time. When I get bored of messing around, I'll probably try to bootstrap and build out my own mobile apps/services end-to-end on my own.\nI too, never thought I'd be in this situation, financially. To be frank, I was actually once homeless (due to poor luck, circumstances outside of my control and a lack of a family and friends safety net.) Crawling out of my financial hole, to survive, I regularly worked jobs I hated at 80-100 hours per week to make ends meet. As a result, I've gotten accustomed to working 60+ hours and became extremely good at time management. I also figure, in high school, my school day was from 8am - 4pm, plus 4 hours in the evening for homework -- so in a way, I've been \"working\" 12 hours per day my entire life.\nJuggling 2 jobs is really hard. I don't recommend it for everyone, but my big carrot on my own stick is that, at 30, if I live within my means, I'll theoretically never have to work another day again in my life. \nMy life breakdown is generally like so -- there are 168 hours in a week, so 60-80 of those are already syphoned off to working, leaving me 88-108 hours. I usually sleep 6-8 hours total within a day, bringing me down to 32-66 hours of free time to eat food, mess around, or whatever. I allocate and plan accordingly.\n\n\n",

With 2 Big 4 internships and a Dropbox competing offer, it should be pretty easy.\nWith the 120k / 3.5 years, the Microsoft offer might be better. I think Dropbox just filed for IPO about 2 weeks ago, so it's still paper money, and you won't get to cash out like the people who are there since many years. If it's anything like the Snapchat IPO, it might be worth a lot less in the nest few months.\nFor the experience, Dropbox might be better, but if your decision is based solely on compensation, get that 120k stock and MSFT is definitely better. Or try and negotiate with Dropbox, but I don't they will without a competing offer from a better Big 4.\nEDIT: MSFT also has a target bonus of 10%, with a max of 20%. So you can add around 10.8k to that base salary if you're just an average new grad.\n\n",

If people find this useful by all means I won't stand in the way.\nThat being said, I feel like an intern's primary goal should be to make sure they're working somewhere that provides valuable experience. That being said, I also think interns should be paid well, but it should take a back seat to how it the experience will position you in the future.\nI was an intern for three years, and now interview intern candidates each year. When I looked for internships for myself, I looked for things like:\n\nAre interns embedded with the other software engineers (preferred), or working on another project on the side?\nDoes the salary cover all of my living expenses plus a little extra?\nWill I get strong mentorship from an experienced engineer?\nWill the work be interesting, enjoyable, and challenging?\nIs there an opportunity to work part time after going back to school?\n\nThese are all way more important to your career than salary. Yet still, I interview some interns who will have multiple offers that will compare them more or less based on the salary. Like, $company is paying me $x, can you match that? Nothing terribly wrong with asking that question, but for many of them it's clear that the answer is a strong determinant of where they will chose to work, which I think is wrong. \n\n",
